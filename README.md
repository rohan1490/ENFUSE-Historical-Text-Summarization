# ENFUSE-Text-Summarization

Human language interpretation and generation is one of the most complex problems faced and it remains an unsolved mystery. To address this issue, Natural Language processing (NLP) which is a subset of AI has been developed and used in various applications such as email filtering, sentiment analysis, language translation. Another important usage of NLP is text summarization which breaks down a large corpus of sentences into few meaningful sentence. This process largely reduces the read-times and important information is filtered and extracted in the shortest amount of time. In this research paper, we implement a NLP model for the company DMC Tours to help them with their tourism business. Large relevant historical texts such as books, articles which are relevant to the history of two countries India and Ireland are collected as a part of input for the summarization model. Next, we implement Sequence to Sequence summarization model with attention mechanism which is trained using the news summary dataset to get relevant summary. We compare the model with three pretrained models (BERT, GPT2 and XLNet) and find that BERT model performed with superior results (ROUGE score of 0.5).
