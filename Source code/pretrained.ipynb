discussed with him the question of restriction of jute cultivation in india and he gave me valuable suggestions as to how he would tackle the problem if he were put in charge. bose stated how on the whole he found the work of the irish government of interest and of value to indians who would soon have to tackle the problem of nation building through the machinery of state themselves. pragmatic and profitable exchanges abounded between the two parties. de valera already knew patel and bose but he would now meet the newly appointed prime minister jawaharlal nehru whose career reflected many

nations today india ireland the common struggle for independence although the early nineteen hundreds directed the imperial world into an inevitable demise the long shadow of the british empire continues to eclipse a quarter of the world s nations today. out of these previously conquered regions ireland and india deemed to be the two most important to the british during the rst half of the twentieth century. to further enhance the general understanding of british rule in the twentieth century it is also crucial to examine the relationship between ireland and india revealing the dark and oppressive state of this empire a state which held innocent people against their will for their own venal motives. in 1920 eamon de valera the president of the sinn fein party of ireland published a pamphlet through the freedom friends of india titled india ireland in 1920 eamon de valera the president of the sinn fein party of ireland published a pamphlet through the freedom friends of india titled india ireland. in this pamphlet which was also read as a speech in new york city hosted by the freedom friends of india de valera dedicated the message to comparing the common anguish experienced under british rule in india to that of the oppression of ireland. due to their common loss of not only wealth but in actual blood the irish cultivated a sense of empathy with the indians de valera 1920 . ireland maintained a status of being imperialist all the while being colonized by great britain. on the other hand the british saw the people of india as inferior to irish people. this bigoted and discriminatory perspective the british maintained against any other nationality being drawn by author and historian michael sylvestri proved that these contradictory irish identities allowed indian and especially indian nationalists to embrace the irish a fellow subject race. in addition british inuenced irish identity began to gradually deteriorate as the eve of the first world war commenced allowing for the indian people to relate to the irish in a much more realistic manner. this war eventually led to treaty between ireland and britain allowing for an independent or dominion state which permitted a version of self governance. this proves that the communication and alliance between india and ireland transitioned from a merely nonexistent state of correspondence into an alliance stimulated by synonymous experiences. india ireland deconstruction of the text the pseudo president of ireland de valera analyzes the commonalities between irish and indian oppression from british rule in a pamphlet titled india ireland. written by an irish nationalist this pamphlet provides an extensive trail of evidence supporting the notion that irish and indian alliances grew stronger under british oppression. in this pamphlet de valera frequently compares irish and indian aspirations to george washington and his efforts during the american revolution. wouldn t even be capable of comprehending the death toll of 32 000 000 starved families. he continues by stating that the british once saw the growing population of the irish as threat to british rule and that this is simultaneously occurring in india. by including this de valera further expresses the empathy of irish for british oppression in india. this information reveals the brutality inicted upon the people of india contributing to the central theme of violence argued by this web page. by connecting the relationship between the irish and the indians he decrees that both identities needed to ght britain in order to attain independence. towards the end of his work the irish nationalist states it is of course always by the sword that she has maintained herself in ireland as in india but she prefers to maintain herself with the sword in its scabbard if she can. by creating this metaphor de valera declares that violence and military action are the only ways the british empire will decide to bring their soldiers back to the united kingdom though de valera describes their geographical and ecological differences he makes sure to highlight the similarities between the two nations. at the time the decision to attack the crowd in punjab was vetted by sir michael o dwyer an irish lieutenant governor for the british in india. even in a bangali article written in india during this time it stated that such is the difference between ireland and india india is a conquered country inhabited by black people she is merely a zamindari of the conquerors. this of course seemed very appealing to all non british listeners and readers at the time in silvestri s the sinn fein of india the author mentions gandhi and his opinion on de valera. he was known for respecting de valera s aspirations for independence but compared him to general dyer in his method towards attaining independence. gandhi proved that a peaceful approach to ghting oppression resides as an alternative. public history has played a role through the entire last century however. it was proven how public history impacted the irish and indians during the times of the early twentieth century using the bangali and daily mail articles of course de valera is still remembered as a champion and instigator of irish independence though gandhi continues to be known globally as a leader of peaceful revolution something that de valera said to be impossible. now over a century after independence irish people continue to commemorate the easter rising in 1916. clearly the heroism and leadership during the time of the revolution continued to maintain a positive tone among the irish public. 9 ireland india and empire indo irish radical connections 1919 64 in this stimulating book or thesis as it is described on p.  2 rather betraying its origins the author claims to meet four principal objectives. in this chapter the links between irish and indian radicals are explored in such bodies as the league against imperialism lai which according to fenner brockway sought to create a unity between organisations representing the subject races of the world . among the indo irish parallels observed here is the distinctly fissiparous tendency of radical groups. 1 but the question which we might pose however is whether the irish experience actually made any difference to the indian simply preparing a catalogue of indian admirers of say collins or de valera and of course noting that irish independence preceded indian does not necessarily prove any significant causal relationship between the two nationalist movements. indeed extracting only irish references from indian memoirs might actually over emphasise the importance of ireland. o malley achieves her second objective more successfully than her first. we find irish republicans and antiimperialists alike living off moscow gold . the fact that irish republicans like nationalists in india and other parts of the world were prepared to accept subsidies from communists sources does not of course mean that they were themselves communist but it does help explain the perception of british security and intelligence agencies in the 1920s and 30s that soviet communism was the principal global challenge the empire faced the over emphasis which o malley identifies at the very start of her book. the argument here is not that communism was not a threat for it surely was but that in context it was not so paramount a threat as many believed. although a number of scholars have worked on the topic of indian revolutionaries and their international networks most notably richard popplewell and tom fraser in his important and pioneering unpublished phd thesis 2 and some use has already been made of these papers which comprise the records of the indian government s security and intelligence department o malley identifies ipi files as a crucial aspect of her study p under arthur griffith indeed sinn f in had begun as a non violent party though it did not remain so for very long. now there surely is a productive subject for comparative study. after all the irish have their very own fascinating celtic tales. much like india the irish can boast of an ancient and revered culture. and somewhere along the way our ancestors managed to meet and exchange musical notes in the iron age literary ideas in the 19th century and more recently tech trade innovations 5 surprising bonds shared between india and ireland talk to an irishman on indian mythology ying elephants shape shifters multiple headed demons and he ll know exactly what you re talking about. 3 when tagore met yeats in st clearly we enjoyed a lively cultural exchange even in centuries gone by while celtic horns are no longer in use in ireland music continues to be an integral part of their culture. both countries strived for independence and a revolution was taking place almost simultaneously in india and ireland. flag colours and alphabetical placement are just some of the coincidental connections between ireland and india. there is pallonji mistry who as an irish citizen is one of the richest men in both countries. the tragic savita halappanavar case which exposed the failures of irish abortion policy is another. khan noted that indians did not have to spend on heating and had cheaper food. most of ireland s agricultural produce went to britain to fuel its rapidly growing cities and military expeditions. sir charles potato forced to export grain irish peasants came to depend on potatoes. another consequence might be that the british never promoted potatoes in india as they had in ireland. our per capita consumption is still relatively low and we eat them as a vegetable not a starchy staple as the irish had. queen s college belfast were particularly prominent in their ability to supply the british empire with a variety of specialists. irish doctors manned india s medical services and irish missionaries ran many schools. another telling detail not from crosbie is that as many as 50 victoria crosses britain s highest military honour were awarded to irish soldiers in india after the suppression of the rising of 1857. crosbie notes how irish inuence was particularly strong in the great trignometrical survey the massive project undertaken by the british in 1802 71 to map the subcontinent. irish wife both of whom had died and left him to be

of the scale shape and contours of the country. but kipling s depiction of the irish as loyal servants of the british was more hopeful than real. in reality the spirit of irish nationalism lived on as did indian nationalism adapting to working within the british system irish wife both of whom had died and left him to be raised in the bazaars of india. in both countries the british had hoped to create an educated class to support their rule and while many did others reinvigorated the nationalist spirit. irish nationalists like charles parnell and indian nationalists like dadabhai naoroji used the freedoms of the british parliament to highlight the british exploitation in reality the spirit of irish nationalism lived on as did indian nationalism adapting to working within the british system. this took her to india which gave her wider scope for her activities. she helped establish the indian national congress and attracted other irish activists to follow her like james and margaret cousins. james was a poet who would inuence writers like the kannada poet and irish battalion ared into mutiny in jalandhar and solan in june 1920. the soldiers wore sinn fein irish nationalist rosettes and one group led by private james daly tried to seize the solan armoury this took her to india which gave her wider scope for her activities. the soldiers wore sinn fein irish

valera had overseen the irish transition from violence to negotiated peace and had been taoiseach and would be again but at that moment was leader of the opposition. he had recently travelled to india where he had been very warmly received by nehru. kate o malley an irish historian notes that the birmingham invitation was met with scepticism perhaps from parts of the british press who viewed de valera as a gure of enmity de valera had overseen the irish transition from violence to negotiated peace and had been taoiseach and would be again but at that moment was leader of the opposition. the irish were at once colonisers and colonised they helped run the indian empire though they were like the indians a subject people. from as early as the 1840s as sean ryder demonstrates irish nationalists made common cause with india in the anti imperialist rhetoric of young ireland. there are many irish voices in kipling s early indian stories and poems most centrally mulvaney the key character of the trio whose adventures are chronicled in soldiers three. it is hard to know which is more likely to make irish readers gnash their molars mulvaney s appalling travesty of an irish accent or kipling s summation of his countrymen that quaint crooked sweet profoundly irresponsible and profoundly loveable race that fight like fiends argue like children reason like women obey like men and jest like their own goblins of the rath through rebellion loyalty want woe or war. how s your blood pressure doing after reading that nagai with admirable dispassionateness shows how mulvaney is used by kipling to head off the threat of irish rebelliousness there are suggestions of fenianism in mulvaney s past. in an indian context he becomes a staunch if somewhat erratic imperial loyalist. but as nagai tellingly shows also the analogies between india and ireland could be read another way as they were by maud gonne in her construction of queen victoria as the famine queen on the occasion of the monarch s visit to ireland in 1900. hi 30s and 40s de valera talking to nehru and lady mountbatten during his visit to india 1948. patel was also with de valera in st throughout his time in dublin patel encouraged irish people to copy the boycott of british goods that was proving so successful in india. such tactics had of course been adopted in ireland at the beginning of the economic war and a few months after patel s visit an phoblacht carried advertisements for a new shop the indian stores on dame street that would facilitate those wishing to boycott british goods in their entirety patel took part in some public ceremonies while in ireland. amon de valera with indian prime minister pandit jawaharlal nehru during his visit to india in 1948. catherine de courcy tells the curious story of sir charles trevelyan s an insight into irish aid workers experiences of the indian subcontinent. de valera begins with declaring that america s revolution should be an example to not only to the irish and their independence movement but to india as well. the laboring classes can bring about change if they want to if they do not they are guilty with the others states de valera and when representatives of these classes come to their fellow laborers in america we believe the americans will not be slow to remind them of this fact he even stressed the superiority of americans due their leadership and action to rid the chains of british rule. he proclaimed that americans wouldn t even be capable of comprehending the death toll of 32 000 000 starved families. de valera added that the british always pretended that massacres such as those led by dyer are cruel but afterwards they trusted that violence is necessary to maintain control in foreign and subject nations. so no comparison should be attempted between ireland and india it was proven how public history impacted the irish and indians during the times of the early twentieth century using the bangali and daily mail articles. irishmen anyhow should not be deceived by the british cant about the indians.\n"

            "politics learning the tricks of the imperial secession trade irish and indian nationalism in the 30s and 40s throughout the first half ofthe twentieth century many household names from the indian nationalist movement came to ireland. keen friendships developed between a variety of irish and indian agitators embracing many of the leading political and literary figures of the day from both countries. the formation of this group was the brainchild of some formidable figures from both countries independence movements. an indian irish independence league meeting in college green during his 1932 trip attracted as many as 3 000 people. patel was also with de valera in st stephen s green on 3 july 1932 at the unveiling of the countess markievicz memorial. we are told by the irish press how a white clad grey haired figure in a square white gandhi cap mr patel looked quite at home in this dublin crowd who pressed round to shake hands and wish india god speed . throughout his time in dublin patel encouraged irish people to copy the boycott of british goods that was proving so successful in india. while in ireland patel befriended a prominent republican family the woods of donnybrook. mary mollie woods became heavily involved in the indian irish independence league. on 5 february he listened to proceedings in the d il from a seat in the visitors gallery. he had interviews with the minister for defence frank aiken the minister for finance se n macentee and the minister for industry and commerce se n lemass as well as with the labour party leader william norton fianna f il td pl. it seems that his meetings with irish ministerswere most worthwhile besides having prolonged discussions with mr de valera i met individually most of the fianna f il ministers. all of them are exceedingly sympathetic accessible and humane. according to bose with the minister for agriculture i discussed how they were trying to make the country self sufficient in the matter of food supply it was interesting to know that wheat and sugar beet were now being cultivated in large areas and the development of agriculture was making the country less dependent on cattle rearing and therefore less dependent on the english market. i also discussed with him the question of restriction of jute cultivation in india and he gave me valuable suggestions as to how he would tackle the problem if he were put in charge. bose stated how on the whole he found the work of the irish government of interest and of value to indians who would soon have to tackle the problem of nation building through the machinery of state themselves. pragmatic and profitable exchanges abounded between the two parties. de valera already knew patel and bose but he would now meet the newly appointed prime minister jawaharlal nehru whose career reflected many aspects of his own. having recently adopted constitutional nationalism at the expense of partition the one time revolutionary was preparing a warm reception for the one time irish freedom fighter who had inspired so many indians over the years. the visit was the beginning of a fond friendship between thetwo men. it was poignant though clearly not orchestrated that de valera was one of the viceroy s last guests given the part played by ireland in the breakup of the british empire. the irish soldier worshipped as an indian god

theosophist poet and indian activist. the imperial connection took irish people to india for very different reasons as soldiers and administrators as seekers forspiritual truth or as missionaries such

mean that we are spared another atrociousirish accent. as with mulvaney kim s irishness is meant to function as a powerful antidote to irish conspiracy . however nagai argues that the book has to be seen in the context of south africa where it was written and kipling s new conceptionof empire made urgent by the boer war which was just ending when it was published. in kipling s previous indian work written when he was actually living there in the 1880s there is a constant sense of the need for the british to maintain theirdistinctive englishness against the threat of the alien environment

ancestors managed to meet and exchange musical notes in the iron age literary ideas in the 19th century and more recently tech trade innovations 5 surprising bonds shared between india and ireland talk to an irishman on indian mythology ying elephants shape shifters multiple headed demons and he ll know exactly what you re talking about. most irish pride themselves in their ability to play an instrument or hold a tune or croon . little wonder that the music band to take home the most number of grammy awards a whooping 22 is the irish band u2. flag colours and alphabetical placement are just some of the coincidental connections between ireland and india. there is pallonji mistry who as an irish citizen is one of the richest men in both countries. the tragic savita halappanavar case which exposed the failures of irish abortion policy is another. most of ireland s agricultural produce went to britain to fuel its rapidly growing cities and military expeditions khan noted that indians did not have to spend on heating and had cheaper food. another consequence might be that the british never promoted potatoes in india as they had in ireland. our per capita consumption is still relatively low and we eat them as a vegetable not a starchy staple as the irish had. during the famine the rst public funds for relief came from irish soldiers and clerks employed by the east india company in calcutta. queen s college belfast were particularly prominent in their ability to supply the british empire with a variety of specialists. irish doctors manned india s medical services and irish missionaries ran many schools. crosbie notes how irish inuence was particularly strong in the great trignometrical survey the massive project undertaken by the british in 1802 71 to map the subcontinent. irish wife both of whom had died and left him to be raised in the bazaars of india. kipling s irish characters like father victor in kim and mulvaney in soldiers three are often shown as less prejudiced than the british and able to make a closer link with indians. but kipling s depiction of the irish as loyal servants of the british was more hopeful than real. she helped establish the indian national congress and attracted other irish activists to follow her like james and margaret cousins. james was a poet who would inuence writers like the kannada poet and irish battalion ared into mutiny in jalandhar and solan in june 1920. the soldiers wore sinn fein irish nationalist rosettes and one group led by private james daly tried to seize the solan armoury. he had recently travelled to india where he had been very warmly received by nehru. kate o malley an irish historian notes that the birmingham invitation was met with scepticism perhaps from parts of the british press who viewed de valera as a gure of enmity de valera had overseen the irish transition from violence to negotiated peace and had been taoiseach and would be again but at that moment was leader of the opposition. it seems there is a real place called kil arni in south india it s not just a spoof of killarney. reclaimed as a white sahib kim s gifts of chameleon like disguise are put to use in the great game the imperial network of spies. nagai places kim s irishness in relation to kipling s other uses of irish characters in his work and his changing sense of empire. there are many irish voices in kipling s early indian stories and poems most centrally mulvaney the key character of the trio whose adventures are chronicled in soldiers three. it is hard to know which is more likely to make irish readers gnash their molars mulvaney s appalling travesty of an irish accent or kipling s summation of his countrymen that quaint crooked sweet profoundly irresponsible and profoundly loveable race that fight like fiends argue like children reason like women obey like men and jest like their own goblins of the rath through rebellion loyalty want woe or war. how s your blood pressure doing after reading that nagai with admirable dispassionateness shows how mulvaney is used by kipling to head off the threat of irish rebelliousness there are suggestions of fenianism in mulvaney s past. in an indian context he becomes a staunch if somewhat erratic imperial loyalist. nagai points out that unlike his two english comrades he marries and settles in india after his military term is up for the irishman india can become home in part because of some sort of perceived kinship between the irish and the oriental how s your blood pressure doing after reading that nagai with admirable dispassionateness shows how mulvaney is used by kipling to head off the threat of irish rebelliousness there are suggestions of fenianism in mulvaney s past. but as nagai tellingly shows also the analogies between india and ireland could be read another way as they were by maud gonne in her construction of queen victoria as the famine queen on the occasion of the monarch s visit to ireland in 1900. the irish famine was linked to the terrible famines devastating india at the time and victoria s idealisation as the imperial matriarch mother to all the people of her empire was turned into its opposite the vicious vampire who sucked out the lifeblood of the indian and irish people alike. the irish indian relationship has changed completely over the past half century as indian influences have become prominent features of irish life. hi 30s and 40s de valera talking to nehru and lady mountbatten during his visit to india 1948. such tactics had of course been adopted in ireland at the beginning of the economic war and a few months after patel s visit an phoblacht carried advertisements for a new shop the indian stores on dame street that would facilitate those wishing to boycott british goods in their entirety patel took part in some public ceremonies while in ireland. helping bose look to the future and providing tips on self government were done behind closed doors in contrast to the public rhetoric which centred on both countries shared history and experiences with the treacherous empire it was in fact one of the viceroy s last official functions in his capacity as governorgeneral of india as he was succeeded a week later by chakravarthi rajagopalachari. amon de valera with indian prime minister pandit jawaharlal nehru during his visit to india in 1948. our artefacts piece notes how 50 victoria crosses were awarded to irish soldiers in the british army in the wake of the indian rebellion mutiny of 1857 in modern times irish people both undermined and sustained the british imperial system. catherine de courcy tells the curious story of sir charles trevelyan s an insight into irish aid workers experiences of the indian subcontinent. michael kennedy provides us with a tasty history of indian cuisine in ireland a piece that focuses on more than just the other taj mahal opposite the dental hospital hungry readers will be excused for taking a curry break at this point. on closer inspection should we not challenge the perceived transient nature of contemporary western encounters with india the archetypal images of the backpacker or the yoga devotee and similarly what of the difficulties that many indians have when they come here the indian medic or it employee who has perfect english but may experience a cultural loss in translation with as many as 16 000 indians now resident in ireland we hope that they will become more aware of the many and multifarious connections between our two countries histories as a result of this special edition. both ireland and india faced gruesome realities when combating britannia and these congruent experiences led to an irish sympathy connecting with indian oppression and vice versa one of the bloody realities which india suffered through during this approximate time was amritsar massacre of 1919 in punjab. india ireland deconstruction of the text the pseudo president of ireland de valera analyzes the commonalities between irish and indian oppression from british rule in a pamphlet titled india ireland 17. de valera begins with declaring that america s revolution should be an example to not only to the irish and their independence movement but to india as well. de valera added that the british always pretended that massacres such as those led by dyer are cruel but afterwards they trusted that violence is necessary to maintain control in foreign and subject nations. so no comparison should be attempted between ireland and india it was proven how public history impacted the irish and indians during the times of the early twentieth century using the bangali and daily mail articles. we of irish blood ought to have no difficulty in seeing through the pretenses of the british government when it is unwiuing to do right.\n"

            "politics learning the tricks of the imperial secession trade irish and indian nationalism in the 30s and 40s throughout the first half ofthe twentieth century many household names from the indian nationalist movement came to ireland. keen friendships developed between a variety of irish and indian agitators embracing many of the leading political and literary figures of the day from both countries. the formation of this group was the brainchild of some formidable figures from both countries independence movements. an indian irish independence league meeting in college green during his 1932 trip attracted as many as 3 000 people. patel was also with de valera in st stephen s green on 3 july 1932 at the unveiling of the countess markievicz memorial. we are told by the irish press how a white clad grey haired figure in a square white gandhi cap mr patel looked quite at home in this dublin crowd who pressed round to shake hands and wish india god speed . throughout his time in dublin patel encouraged irish people to copy the boycott of british goods that was proving so successful in india. while in ireland patel befriended a prominent republican family the woods of donnybrook. mary mollie woods became heavily involved in the indian irish independence league. on 5 february he listened to proceedings in the d il from a seat in the visitors gallery. he had interviews with the minister for defence frank aiken the minister for finance se n macentee and the minister for industry and commerce se n lemass as well as with the labour party leader william norton fianna f il td pl. it seems that his meetings with irish ministerswere most worthwhile besides having prolonged discussions with mr de valera i met individually most of the fianna f il ministers. all of them are exceedingly sympathetic accessible and humane. according to bose with the minister for agriculture i discussed how they were trying to make the country self sufficient in the matter of food supply it was interesting to know that wheat and sugar beet were now being cultivated in large areas and the development of agriculture was making the country less dependent on cattle rearing and therefore less dependent on the english market. i also discussed with him the question of restriction of jute cultivation in india and he gave me valuable suggestions as to how he would tackle the problem if he were put in charge. bose stated how on the whole he found the work of the irish government of interest and of value to indians who would soon have to tackle the problem of nation building through the machinery of state themselves. pragmatic and profitable exchanges abounded between the two parties. de valera already knew patel and bose but he would now meet the newly appointed prime minister jawaharlal nehru whose career reflected many aspects of his own. having recently adopted constitutional nationalism at the expense of partition the one time revolutionary was preparing a warm reception for the one time irish freedom fighter who had inspired so many indians over the years. the visit was the beginning of a fond friendship between thetwo men. it was poignant though clearly not orchestrated that de valera was one of the viceroy s last guests given the part played by ireland in the breakup of the british empire. the irish soldier worshipped as an indian god

exceptionalfigures committed themselves completely to india. the career of margaret noble from co tyrone aka sister nivedita hindu nun and supporter of the bengali revolutionary movement is the subject of two studies by maina singh and ellekeboehmer there are essays by selina guinness and joseph lennon on the radical political theories and the post colonialaesthetics of james cousins irish theosophist poet and indian activist. the imperial connection took irish people to india for very different reasons as soldiers and administrators as seekers forspiritual truth or as missionaries such as thomas gavan duffy whose bizarre sounding propaganda film the catechist ofkil arni is analysed by fiona bateman. ot2 2mulvaney is kim s irish forerunner though the circumstances of his upbringing mean that we are spared another atrociousirish accent. as with mulvaney kim s irishness is meant to function as a powerful antidote to irish conspiracy . however nagai argues that the book has to be seen in the context of south africa where it was written and kipling s new conceptionof empire made urgent by the boer war which was just ending when it was published. in kipling s previous indian work written when he was actually living there in the 1880s there is a constant sense of the need for the british to maintain theirdistinctive englishness against the threat of the alien environment

there surely is a productive subject for comparative study. the author is happy to accept this review and does not wish to comment further 10 the author is happy to accept this review and does not

instrument or hold a tune or croon . little wonder that the music band to take home the most number of grammy awards a whooping 22 is the irish band u2. flag colours and alphabetical placement are just some of the coincidental connections between ireland and india. there is pallonji mistry who as an irish citizen is one of the richest men in both countries. the tragic savita halappanavar case which exposed the failures of irish abortion policy is another. most of ireland s agricultural produce went to britain to fuel its rapidly growing cities and military expeditions khan noted that indians did not have to spend on heating and had cheaper food. another consequence might be that the british never promoted potatoes in india as they had in ireland. our per capita consumption is still relatively low and we eat them as a vegetable not a starchy staple as the irish had. during the famine the rst public funds for relief came from irish soldiers and clerks employed by the east india company in calcutta. queen s college belfast were particularly prominent in their ability to supply the british empire with a variety of specialists. irish doctors manned india s medical services and irish missionaries ran many schools. crosbie notes how irish inuence was particularly strong in the great trignometrical survey the massive project undertaken by the british in 1802 71 to map the subcontinent. irish wife both of whom had died and left him to be raised in the bazaars of india. kipling s irish characters like father victor in kim and mulvaney in soldiers three are often shown as less prejudiced than the british and able to make a closer link with indians. but kipling s depiction of the irish as loyal servants of the british was more hopeful than real. she helped establish the indian national congress and attracted other irish activists to follow her like james and margaret cousins. james was a poet who would inuence writers like the kannada poet and irish battalion ared into mutiny in jalandhar and solan in june 1920. the soldiers wore sinn fein irish nationalist rosettes and one group led by private james daly tried to seize the solan armoury. he had recently travelled to india where he had been very warmly received by nehru. kate o malley an irish historian notes that the birmingham invitation was met with scepticism perhaps from parts of the british press who viewed de valera as a gure of enmity de valera had overseen the irish transition from violence to negotiated peace and had been taoiseach and would be again but at that moment was leader of the opposition. it seems there is a real place called kil arni in south india it s not just a spoof of killarney. reclaimed as a white sahib kim s gifts of chameleon like disguise are put to use in the great game the imperial network of spies. nagai places kim s irishness in relation to kipling s other uses of irish characters in his work and his changing sense of empire. there are many irish voices in kipling s early indian stories and poems most centrally mulvaney the key character of the trio whose adventures are chronicled in soldiers three. it is hard to know which is more likely to make irish readers gnash their molars mulvaney s appalling travesty of an irish accent or kipling s summation of his countrymen that quaint crooked sweet profoundly irresponsible and profoundly loveable race that fight like fiends argue like children reason like women obey like men and jest like their own goblins of the rath through rebellion loyalty want woe or war. how s your blood pressure doing after reading that nagai with admirable dispassionateness shows how mulvaney is used by kipling to head off the threat of irish rebelliousness there are suggestions of fenianism in mulvaney s past. in an indian context he becomes a staunch if somewhat erratic imperial loyalist. nagai points out that unlike his two english comrades he marries and settles in india after his military term is up for the irishman india can become home in part because of some sort of perceived kinship between the irish and the oriental how s your blood pressure doing after reading that nagai with admirable dispassionateness shows how mulvaney is used by kipling to head off the threat of irish rebelliousness there are suggestions of fenianism in mulvaney s past. but as nagai tellingly shows also the analogies between india and ireland could be read another way as they were by maud gonne in her construction of queen victoria as the famine queen on the occasion of the monarch s visit to ireland in 1900. the irish famine was linked to the terrible famines devastating india at the time and victoria s idealisation as the imperial matriarch mother to all the people of her empire was turned into its opposite the vicious vampire who sucked out the lifeblood of the indian and irish people alike. the irish indian relationship has changed completely over the past half century as indian influences have become prominent features of irish life. hi 30s and 40s de valera talking to nehru and lady mountbatten during his visit to india 1948. such tactics had of course been adopted

translation with as many as 16 000 indians now resident in ireland we hope that they will become more aware of the many and multifarious connections between our two countries histories as a result of this special edition. both ireland and india faced gruesome realities when combating britannia and these congruent experiences led to an irish sympathy connecting with indian oppression and vice versa one of the bloody realities which india suffered through during this approximate time was amritsar massacre of 1919 in punjab. india ireland deconstruction of the text the pseudo president of ireland de valera analyzes the commonalities between irish and indian oppression from british rule in a pamphlet titled india ireland 17. de valera begins with declaring that america s revolution should be an example to not only to the irish and their independence movement but to india as well. de valera added that the british always pretended that massacres such as those led by dyer are cruel but afterwards they trusted that violence is necessary to maintain control in foreign and subject nations. so no comparison should be attempted between ireland and india it was proven how public history impacted the irish and indians during the times of the early twentieth century using the bangali and daily mail articles. we of irish blood ought to have no difficulty in seeing through the pretenses of the british government when it is unwiuing to do right.\n",

            "j.  patel and the indian irish independence leaguein the pages of an phoblacht on 30 july 1932 there appeared an article announcing the formation of a group calling itself the indian irish independence league . the formation of this group was the brainchild of some formidable figures from both countries independence movements. on the irish side maud gonne macbride charlotte despard frank ryan and peadar o donnell were founder members and the indian politician most prominent was vithalbhai javerbhai v v. j.  patel had in fact travelled to ireland four times throughout the 1920s and 30s. the british intelligence services in the form of its indian political intelligence ipi section kept track of his movements and contacts in ireland. they were clearly anxious that ireland was providing indian nationalists with pertinent revolutionary precedents. the ipi was headed by an irishman and trinity college dublin graduate philip vickery and also had amongst its ranks another loyal irish servant of the crown and one time trinity man charles tegart. an indian irish independence league meeting in college green during his 1932 trip attracted as many as 3 000 people. patel was also with de valera in st stephen s green on 3 july 1932 at the unveiling of the countess markievicz memorial we are told by the irish press how a white clad grey haired figure in a square white gandhi cap mr patel looked quite at home in this dublin crowd who pressed round to shake hands and wish india god speed . throughout his time in dublin patel encouraged irish people to copy the boycott of british goods that was proving so successful in india. commenting on the patel de valera friendship that had developed as a result of his trips to ireland one british official noted it rather emphasises that fact that many of us have urged that the congress party are largely founding themselves on the methods by which the irish free state secured practical independence of great britain . patel died soon after in geneva in 1933 with another famous indian radical subhas chandra bose at his bedside. in the same way that ireland has been bedevilled by the never ending collins versus de valera debate bose left the indian people with equally divided loyalties gandhiji or netaji between 1933 and 1936 bose was a rovingambassador for indian independence in europe. bose himself addressed the meeting where speakers also included the prominent left wing activists peadar o donnell se n murray frank ryan and se n macbride. helping bose look to the future and providing tips on self government were done behind closed doors in contrast to the public rhetoric which centred on both countries shared history and experiences with the treacherous empire. in the wake of his visit to ireland bose continued to write and receive letters and press cuttings from his fond friend the left wing republican mollie woods. india had just been partitioned and as in ireland this was carried out along religious lines and coincided with thetransfer of power from britain the similarities were uncanny in the wake of his visit to ireland bose continued to write and receive letters and press cuttings from his fond friend the left wing republican mollie woods. de valera already knew patel and bose but he would now meet the newly appointed prime minister jawaharlal nehru whose career reflected many aspects of his own. the commonwealth relations office warned the high commissioners of both india and pakistan in advance of de valera s visit that it might have the effect of encouraging yet further examination in india and perhaps pakistan of the possible applicability of a solution on lines similar to those adopted in ire to the problem of the future position of india and pakistan in the commonwealth . de valera and frank aiken arrived in calcutta on the morning of 14 june 1948. from there they travelled to delhi to government house where they stayed for the next two days with nehru . for more than 30 years many of us in ireland have followed with deepest sympathy the fortunes of the people of india in their efforts to secure freedom. we regarded the people of india as co workers and allies in a common cause and we rejoiced exceedingly when india s right to independence was fully acknowledged. it was in fact one of the viceroy s last official functions in his capacity as governor general of india as he was succeeded a week later by chakravarthi rajagopalachari. it was poignant though clearly not orchestrated that de valera was one of the viceroy s last guests given the part played by ireland in the breakup of the british empire. ireland and india are both republics and ah yes they were both once parts of the british empire. ireland and india emerged from anuig conference in 2004 there has just been a second conference on the same theme at the jawaharlal nehru university indelhi. there were for instance the administrators who moved from one end of the empire to the other such as cornwallis who inthe 18th century served successively in america india and ireland charles trevelyan whose notorious period of office inireland during the famine was preceded and followed by extended terms in india or sir anthony mcdonnell a long serving officer in the indian civil service who found himself in a quite different situation as an irish catholic imperialistwhen he became under secretary of state for ireland at the beginning of the 20th century. the irish were at once colonisers and colonised they helped run the indian empire though they were like the indians asubject people. for some writers most notably yeats india remained a key territory of the mind a place of the cultural uncanny asmalcolm sen calls it. and if india looms large in the imagination of yeats even though he never visited it kipling with nospecial connections to ireland chose to make the central character in his major indian novel irish. the irish famine was linked to the terrible famines devastating india at the time and victoria s idealisation as theimperial matriarch mother to all the people of her empire was turned into its opposite the vicious vampire who sucked outthe lifeblood of the indian and irish people alike. a little more than a hundred years ago an organiseduprising against colonial rule took place in europe next door to the british in ireland in april 1916. that ireland was a colony of the british for so long is a factmany are not even aware of. at that time it was nominallyindependent and even had its own parliament. but the kingof england was the king of ireland and he appointed aviceroy to supervise its affairs. in 1801 this arrangementwas done away with the united kingdom of great britainand ireland was formed and the irish

irish foreign policy series. india ireland the common struggle for independence although the early nineteen hundreds directed the imperial world into an inevitable demise the long shadow of the british empire continues to eclipse a quarter of the world s nations today. out of these previously conquered regions ireland and india deemed to be the two most important to the british during the rst half of the twentieth century. to further enhance the general understanding of british rule in the twentieth century it is also crucial to examine the relationship between ireland and india revealing the dark and oppressive state of this empire a state which held innocent people against their will for their own venal motives. in 1920 eamon de valera the president of the sinn fein party of ireland published a pamphlet through the freedom friends of india titled india ireland. in this pamphlet which was also read as a speech in new york city hosted by the freedom friends of india de valera dedicated the message to comparing the common anguish experienced under british rule in india to that of the oppression of ireland by looking through the window of the irish perspective one may learn to further understand the wholesome reality of the british empire and the public history rewritten by british enthusiasts. due to their common loss of not only wealth but in actual blood the irish cultivated a sense of empathy with the indians de valera 1920 . furthermore this page will uphold the notion that de valera promoted vehement and militant strategy in urge to overthrow britain in his speech to the freedom friends of india. ordered by general reginald dyer the british authorities sought to control this setting of a few hundred peaceful protestors with gunre which ultimate led to the loss 379 lives. the relationship between ireland and india began to morph into a harmonious alliance following these common struggles under british rule. oppression continued in ireland as the irish fought the anglo irish war from 1919 1921 via guerilla war tactics organized by irish nationalists. this war eventually led to treaty between ireland and britain allowing for an independent or dominion state which permitted a version of self governance oppression continued in ireland as the irish fought the anglo irish war from 1919 1921 via guerilla war tactics organized by irish nationalists. india gained great inspiration from the success of the irish for the anglo irish conict provided inspiration for nationalist movements in both india and egypt. this proves that the communication and alliance between india and ireland transitioned from a merely nonexistent state of correspondence into an alliance stimulated by synonymous experiences. this brief insight of the context of the irish and indian independence movements expose the commonality of the violence which occurred on both irish and indian lands the cause of this being conicting linguistic and sectarian cultures. in this pamphlet de valera frequently compares irish and indian aspirations to george washington and his efforts during the american revolution. some of these were the articles written in the bangali and daily mail. however as modern historians refer back to this work as primary source of irish history the avoidance of mentioning o dwyer allows for this fact in history to saturate into the limitless historical archives and conclusions made of the past. while de valera championed for ireland during the revolution the british had their take on public history and wrote articles hoping to discourage other nations to follow ireland s lead. this of course seemed very appealing to all non british listeners and readers at the time. although this was the case the ethics to de valera s motives come into question when analyzing india ireland especially doing so after india gained independence in 1947 through aiming to inspire the indians to spark violence against british authorities he establishes ireland as a leader in the decolonization movement. india gained independence from britain through a much more peaceful process compared to 3 16 2021 india ireland the common struggle for independence contested representations debating britain s imperial legacy contestedrepresentations. in silvestri s the sinn fein of india the author mentions gandhi and his opinion on de valera. clearly the heroism and leadership during the time of the revolution continued to maintain a positive tone among the irish public. at the time articles written for public history has played a crucial role in shaping the independence movements for both india and ireland as well as contributing to modern day understandings of these valuable moments in history. kate o malley s book undoubtedly contributes to the process articulated by erskine childers as quoted at the start of this review. o malley observes that in the first half of the twentieth century british indian and irish elites alike believed that fundamental parallels between the two countries historical experiences formed the basis of a developing indo irish political nexus p o malley observes that in the first half of the twentieth century british indian and irish elites alike believed that fundamental parallels between the two countries historical experiences formed the basis of a developing indo irish political nexus p.  2 . 3 if the accepted paradigms concern the methods adopted by nationalists across the empire then there is a real problem which o malley recognises in comparing ireland and india and that problem is gandhi who is largely absent from this book. but the evidence for this might not be so conveniently assembled in security and intelligence archives. india might be as imagined a concept as ireland britain or even the british empire . as with gandhi there is not much jinnah in o malley s book though she does not miss the delicious irony of de valera visiting india but not pakistan on his antipartition tour of 1948. just as ancient hindu texts assert that life began when the river ganga descended to earth from shiva s matted locks similarly celtic mythology has goddess danu the mother

catholic majority was denied many rights. mayo to mirza bayly s essay tracing irish indian links in 1780 1914 quotes john stuart mill those englishmen who know something about india are even now those who understand ireland best. ireland was a testing ground for policies later implemented in india and also produced many of the implementers. the lives of irish peasants at that time were so miserable that mirza abu taleb khan one of the rst indian visitors to ireland in 1800 could write that the peasants of india are rich compared with them . sir charles potato forced to export grain irish peasants came to depend on potatoes. in 1845 potato blight hit ireland and the ensuing famine killed a million and forced a million more to emigrate reducing the population by 20 . his policies towards indians were more benevolent than to the irish showing perhaps he had learned from the famine. another consequence might be that the british never promoted potatoes in india as they had in ireland. india beneted from britain s exhaustion with the whole process. a few months later india agreed to join but only with vague acknowledgement of the crown as head of the commonwealth and this time the british quietly agreed. there are two national languages in ireland only one of which most of its citizens can speak fluently there are 22 official languages in india not to mention at least

a lasting alliance between the two nations. india ireland just like kilmainham gaol and w. b due to their common loss of not only wealth but in actual blood the irish cultivated a sense of empathy with the indians de valera 1920 . as india continued to squirm under the thumbs of the british they quickly heard of the successes obtained by irish revolutionaries overseas this war eventually led to treaty between ireland and britain allowing for an independent or dominion state which permitted a version of self governance. india and ireland some one hundred and forty odd years ago general george washington sent the following message to the patriots of ireland patriots of ireland your cause is identical with mine. i trust this message of mine will unite the people of india and the people of ireland in a similar union of mutual understanding which will go on strengthening during the years. that message of washington has been a constant inspiration to the people of ireland. from a remark of one of the previous speakers it might have been inferred that ireland was conquered by britain. no nation that like washington stands true to its cause under ail circumstances ever is conquered we must all be true to our cause even when victory has fled confident that after our valley forge will come surely our yorktown. ireland has never done that and her conduct in the past is a surety that she will never do it. we in ireland comparatively small in numbers close to the seat of britain s imperial power have never despaired. you people of india remote from her a continent in yourselves seventy times as numerous as we are surely you do not despair surely you will not despairj a few years ago a british secretary of state for india in the british house of commons tried to make light of charges that the british were bleeding india to death a nation is conquered only when it abandons its cause and definitely gives way to despair. but terrible as it is it does not surprise us in ireland who know what british rule means. and the shooting of an unarmed a harmless protesting multitude and the hangings and the floggings we have not to go back far in irish history to know of these it must shock you to realize what that means you who live in this land of opportunity and plenty. we were the mere irish the laboring classes can bring about a change if they want to if they do not they are guilty with the others and when representatives of these classes come to their fellow laborers in america we believe the americans will not be slow to remind them of this fact. my friends you know well there is no peculiar difficulty in them. we ought to have no diificulty in understanding the troubles of the people of india and they in their turn should have no difficulty in understanding those of the people of ireland. they should find in the story of ireland s struggle against britain much also that will be of value to them. i commend a careful study of that story to our indian friends here tonight. conditions in india and ireland are no doubt in many respects dissimilar as i pointed out at the start. but there is one lesson that ireland s struggle teaches very plainly. it is only through the influence of fear and the pressure of force that britain has ever been brought to consider even partially the claims of ireland. we have never been able to achieve anything except when we compelled england to rule us with the naked sword. they have long played the hypocrite with success they hate now to see the mask torn from them they have long played the hypocrite with success they hate now to see the mask torn from them. we must use them to the full but we must never forget that we must ultimately rely upon ourselves if we are to be successful. like thomas francis meagher we of today in ireland will not stigmatize the sword but there is no people upon the whole earth who so desire that a world condition should be brought about in which the sword should become unnecessary as we do. and if those who decry physical force only make half the effort to bring it about that we are making it will speedily come.\n",

discussed with him the question of restriction of jute cultivation in india and he gave me valuable suggestions as to how he would tackle the problem if he were put in charge. bose stated how on the whole he found the work of the irish government of interest and of value to indians who would soon have to tackle the problem of nation building through the machinery of state themselves. pragmatic

british empire continues to eclipse a quarter of the world s nations today india ireland the common struggle for independence although the early nineteen hundreds directed the imperial world into an inevitable demise the long shadow of the british empire continues to eclipse a quarter of the world s nations today. out of these previously conquered regions ireland and india deemed to be the two most important to the british during the rst half of the twentieth century. to further enhance the general understanding of british rule in the twentieth century it is also crucial to examine the relationship between ireland and india revealing the dark and oppressive state of this empire a state which held innocent people against their will for their own venal motives. in 1920 eamon de valera the president of the sinn fein party of ireland published a pamphlet through the freedom friends of india titled india ireland in 1920 eamon de valera the president of the sinn fein party of ireland published a pamphlet through the freedom friends of india titled india ireland. in this pamphlet which was also read as a speech in new york city hosted by the freedom friends of india de valera dedicated the message to comparing the common anguish experienced under british rule in india to that of the oppression of ireland. due to their common loss of not only wealth but in actual blood the irish cultivated a sense of empathy with the indians de valera 1920 . ireland maintained a status of being imperialist all the while being colonized by great britain. on the other hand the british saw the people of india as inferior to irish people. this bigoted and discriminatory perspective the british maintained against any other nationality being drawn by author and historian michael sylvestri proved that these contradictory irish identities allowed indian and especially indian nationalists to embrace the irish a fellow subject race. in addition british inuenced irish identity began to gradually deteriorate as the eve of the first world war commenced allowing for the indian people to relate to the irish in a much more realistic manner. this war eventually led to treaty between ireland and britain allowing for an independent or dominion state which permitted a version of self governance. this proves that the communication and alliance between india and ireland transitioned from a merely nonexistent state of correspondence into an alliance stimulated by synonymous experiences. india ireland deconstruction of the text the pseudo president of ireland de valera analyzes the commonalities between irish and indian oppression from british rule in a pamphlet titled india ireland. written by an irish nationalist this pamphlet provides an extensive trail of evidence supporting the notion that irish and indian alliances grew stronger under british oppression. in this pamphlet de valera frequently compares irish and indian aspirations to george washington and his efforts during the american revolution. wouldn t even be capable of comprehending the death toll of 32 000 000 starved families. he continues by stating that the british once saw the growing population of the irish as threat to british rule and that this is simultaneously occurring in india. by including this de valera further expresses the empathy of irish for british oppression in india. this information reveals the brutality inicted upon the people of india contributing to the central theme of violence argued by this web page. by connecting the relationship between the irish and the indians he decrees that both identities needed to ght britain in order to attain independence. towards the end of his work the irish nationalist states it is of course always by the sword that she has maintained herself in ireland as in india but she prefers to maintain herself with the sword in its scabbard if she can. by creating this metaphor de valera declares that violence and military action are the only ways the british empire will decide to bring their soldiers back to the united kingdom though de valera describes their geographical and ecological differences he makes sure to highlight the similarities between the two nations. at the time the decision to attack the crowd in punjab was vetted by sir michael o dwyer an irish lieutenant governor for the british in india. even in a bangali article written in india during this time it stated that such is the difference between ireland and india india is a conquered country inhabited by black people she is merely a zamindari of the conquerors. this of course seemed very appealing to all non british listeners and readers at the time in silvestri s the sinn fein of india the author mentions gandhi and his opinion on de valera. he was known for respecting de valera s aspirations for independence but compared him to general dyer in his method towards attaining independence. gandhi proved that a peaceful approach to ghting oppression resides as an alternative. public history has played a role through the entire last century however. it was proven how public history impacted the irish and indians during the times of the early twentieth century using the bangali and daily mail articles of course de valera is still remembered as a champion and instigator of irish independence though gandhi continues to be known globally as a leader of peaceful revolution something that de valera said to be impossible. now over a century after independence irish people continue to commemorate the easter rising in 1916. clearly the heroism and leadership during the time of the revolution continued to maintain a positive tone among the irish public. 9 ireland india and empire indo irish radical connections 1919 64 in this stimulating book or thesis as it is described on p.  2 rather betraying its origins the author claims to meet four principal objectives. in this chapter the links between irish and indian radicals are explored in such bodies as the league against imperialism lai which according to fenner brockway sought to create a unity between organisations representing the subject races of the world . among the indo irish parallels observed here is the distinctly fissiparous tendency of radical groups. 1 but the question which we might pose however is whether the irish experience actually made any difference to the indian simply preparing a catalogue of indian admirers of say collins or de valera and of course noting that irish independence preceded indian does not necessarily prove any significant causal relationship between the two nationalist movements. indeed extracting only irish references from indian memoirs might actually over emphasise the importance of ireland. o malley achieves her second objective more successfully than her first. we find irish republicans and antiimperialists alike living off moscow gold . the fact that irish republicans like nationalists in india and other parts of the world were prepared to accept subsidies from communists sources does not of course mean that they were themselves communist but it does help explain the perception of british security and intelligence agencies in the 1920s and 30s that soviet communism was the principal global challenge the empire faced the over emphasis which o malley identifies at the very start of her book. the argument here is not that communism was not a threat for it surely was but that in context it was not so paramount a threat as many believed. although a number of scholars have worked on the topic of indian revolutionaries and their international networks most notably richard popplewell and tom fraser in his important and pioneering unpublished phd thesis 2 and some use has already been made of these papers which comprise the records of the indian government s security and intelligence department o malley identifies ipi files as a crucial aspect of her study p under arthur griffith indeed sinn f in had begun as a non violent party though it did not remain so for very long. now there surely is a productive subject for comparative study. after all the irish have their very own fascinating celtic tales. much like india the irish can boast of an ancient and revered culture. and somewhere along the way our ancestors managed to meet and exchange musical notes in the iron age literary ideas in the 19th century and more recently tech trade innovations 5 surprising bonds shared between india and ireland talk to an irishman on indian mythology ying elephants shape shifters multiple headed demons and he ll know exactly what you re talking about. 3 when tagore met yeats in st clearly we enjoyed a lively cultural exchange even in centuries gone by while celtic horns are no longer in use in ireland music continues to be an integral part of their culture. both countries strived for independence and a revolution was taking place almost simultaneously in india and ireland. flag colours and alphabetical placement are just some of the coincidental connections between ireland and india. there is pallonji mistry who as an irish citizen is one of the richest men in both countries. the tragic savita halappanavar case which exposed the failures of irish abortion policy is another. khan noted that indians did not have to spend on heating and had cheaper food. most of ireland s agricultural produce went to britain to fuel its rapidly growing cities and military expeditions. sir charles potato forced to export grain irish peasants came to depend on potatoes. another consequence might be that the british never promoted potatoes in india as they had in ireland. our per capita consumption is still relatively low and we eat them as a vegetable not a starchy staple as the irish had. queen s college belfast were particularly prominent in their ability to supply the british empire with a variety of specialists. irish doctors manned india s medical services and irish missionaries ran many schools. another telling detail not from crosbie is that as many as 50 victoria crosses britain s highest military honour were awarded to irish soldiers in india after the suppression of the rising of 1857. crosbie notes how irish inuence was particularly strong in the great trignometrical survey the massive project undertaken by the british in 1802 71 to map the subcontinent. irish wife both of whom had died and left him to be raised in the bazaars of india. but kipling s depiction of the irish as loyal servants of the british was more hopeful than real the survey had huge importance giving indians and the british a sense of the scale shape and contours of the country. but kipling s depiction of the irish as loyal servants of the british was more hopeful than real. in reality the spirit of irish nationalism lived on as did indian nationalism adapting to working within the british system irish wife both of whom had died and left him to be raised in the bazaars of india. in both countries the british had hoped to create an educated class to support their rule and while many did others reinvigorated the nationalist spirit. irish nationalists like charles parnell and indian nationalists like dadabhai naoroji used the freedoms of the british parliament to highlight the british exploitation in reality the spirit of irish nationalism lived on as did indian nationalism adapting to working within the british system. this took her to india which gave her wider scope for her activities. she helped establish the indian national congress and attracted other irish activists to follow her like james and margaret cousins. james was a poet who would inuence writers like the kannada poet and irish battalion ared into mutiny in jalandhar and solan in june 1920. the soldiers wore sinn fein irish nationalist rosettes and one group led by private james daly tried to seize the solan armoury this took her to india which gave her wider scope for her activities. the soldiers wore sinn fein irish nationalist rosettes and one group led by private james daly tried to seize the solan armoury. he admired terence macswiney the mayor of cork whose hunger strike led to his death in october 1920. de valera had overseen the irish transition from violence to negotiated peace and had been taoiseach and would be again but at that moment was leader of the opposition. he had recently travelled to india where he had been very warmly received by nehru. kate o malley an irish historian notes that the birmingham invitation was met with scepticism perhaps from parts of the british press who viewed de valera as a gure of enmity de valera had overseen the irish transition from violence to negotiated peace and had been taoiseach and would be again but at that moment was leader of the opposition. the irish were at once colonisers and colonised they helped run the indian empire though they were like the indians a subject people. from as early as the 1840s as sean ryder demonstrates irish nationalists made common cause with india in the anti imperialist rhetoric of young ireland. there are many irish voices in kipling s early indian stories and poems most centrally mulvaney the key character of the trio whose adventures are chronicled in soldiers three. it is hard to know which is more likely to make irish readers gnash their molars mulvaney s appalling travesty of an irish accent or kipling s summation of his countrymen that quaint crooked sweet profoundly irresponsible and profoundly loveable race that fight like fiends argue like children reason like women obey like men and jest like their own goblins of the rath through rebellion loyalty want woe or war. how s your blood pressure doing after reading that nagai with admirable dispassionateness shows how mulvaney is used by kipling to head off the threat of irish rebelliousness there are suggestions of fenianism in mulvaney s past. in an indian context he becomes a staunch if somewhat erratic imperial loyalist. ot 2 2 mulvaney is kim s irish forerunner though the circumstances of his upbringing mean that we are spared another atrocious irish accent. but as nagai tellingly shows also the analogies between india and ireland could be read another way as they were by maud gonne in her construction of queen victoria as the famine queen on the occasion of the monarch s visit to ireland in 1900. hi 30s and 40s de valera talking to nehru and lady mountbatten during his visit to india 1948. patel was also with de valera in st throughout his time in dublin patel encouraged irish people to copy the boycott of british goods that was proving so successful in india. such tactics had of course been adopted in ireland at the beginning of the economic war and a few months after patel s visit an phoblacht carried advertisements for a new shop the indian stores on dame street that would facilitate those wishing to boycott british goods in their entirety patel took part in some public ceremonies while in ireland. amon de valera with indian prime minister pandit jawaharlal nehru during his visit to india in 1948. catherine de courcy tells the curious story of sir charles trevelyan s an insight into irish aid workers experiences of the indian subcontinent. de valera begins with declaring that america s revolution should be an example to not only to the irish and their independence movement but to india as well. the laboring classes can bring about change if they want to if they do not they are guilty with the others states de valera and when representatives of these classes come to their fellow laborers in america we believe the americans will not be slow to remind them of this fact he even stressed the superiority of americans due their leadership and action to rid the chains of british rule. he proclaimed that americans wouldn t even be capable of comprehending the death toll of 32 000 000 starved families. de valera added that the british always pretended that massacres such as those led by dyer are cruel but afterwards they trusted that violence is necessary to maintain control in foreign and subject nations. so no comparison should be attempted between ireland and india it was proven how public history impacted the irish and indians during the times of the early twentieth century using the bangali and daily mail articles. irishmen anyhow should not be deceived by the british cant about the indians.'"
